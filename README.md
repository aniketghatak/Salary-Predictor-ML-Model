# ðŸ’¼ Salary Predictor ML Model

This project is a simple and effective **Machine Learning model** built with Python to predict an individual's salary based on their **age** and **years of experience** using **Linear Regression**.

It includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Training and evaluating a regression model using **scikit-learn**
- Interactive user input to predict salary
- Clean visualizations to understand patterns in the data

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Load and visualize the salary dataset
2. Train a **Linear Regression** model using `Age` and `Experience` as input features
3. Evaluate the model using **MSE** and **RÂ² Score**
4. Take user input (**Age** and **Experience**) and return a **Predicted Salary**

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output

Enter Age: 24
Enter Years of Experience: 4

âœ… Expected Salary for Age 24 and Experience 4 years is: â‚¹57,892.34
